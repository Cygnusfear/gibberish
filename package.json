  "description": "Gibberish is designed to be a fast audio API for browser based audio content. Gibberish is different from other JavaScript audio libraries (such as audiolib.js or Audiolet) in that it generates code that is heavily optimized for JIT compilation. The code that is generated is arguably not human-readble, hence the name Gibberish.",
